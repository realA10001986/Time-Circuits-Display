This folder holds all files necessary for immediate installation on your Time Circuits Display. Here you'll find
- a binary of the current firmware, ready for upload to the device ("xxx.bin");
- the latest matching sound-pack ("sound-pack-xxxx.zip")
- some additional bonus sound files ("alt_sound")

For installation instructions, see [here](../README.md#firmware-installation).

Note: As of version 3.20, the internally used file format for secondary and IP settings was changed. Version 3.20 will automatically update old files to the new format, later versions will not. If you intend to update from a version below 3.20 to a version above 3.20, please install [version 3.20](https://github.com/realA10001986/Time-Circuits-Display/releases/tag/V3.20) as an intermediate to have your secondary and IP settings converted.
