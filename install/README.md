This folder holds all files necessary for immediate installation on your Time Circuits Display. Here you'll find
- a binary of the current firmware, ready for upload to the device ("xxx.bin");
- the latest matching sound-pack ("sound-pack-xxxx.zip")
- some additional bonus sound files ("alt_sound")

For installation instructions, see [here](../README.md#firmware-installation).

The bonus sound files need to be copied to an SD card, and this SD card put into the TCD's slot.
